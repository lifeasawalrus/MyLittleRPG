This is a passion project for an open world, isometric local multiplayer role-playing game (RPG) set in the MyLittlePony universe. Currently, the game handles as many players as controllers connected to the user's system. The game is built using the [LOVE2d](https://www.love2d.org/) API as well as the open source [LDTK](https://ldtk.io/) map editor tool. The game is in very early development and exists here as a demonstration of capability at this time.

### Current features

- Player movement controls
- Character select menu function
- Player class characteristics (if you have wings, you can fly)

### Future Updates

- Map object collisions
- Camera zooming when players separate
- Movement to various maps in the world when players collect at teleport points
- Custom controller mappings
- Save game state feature
- Player health, combat, and mobs
- Inventory
- Chance based looting system
- Fishing and farming mechanics
- Custom home building
- NPC interactions and quest/storyline

### Play the Game

Download [LOVE2d](https://www.love2d.org/) on your system, download this repository, connect a controller (keyboard/mouse is not yet supported), navigate to the folder containing the repo in your terminal, and run:


````love MyLittleRPG````

### Controls

Custom controller setup in the menu is yet to be implemented. Explore your controller for the default mappings for kicking, rearing, and jumping. If you have wings, press the rearing button while jumping to fly. The right control stick can be used at this point to adjust your altitude.

### Credits

Map assets were collected from [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/)

Player character assets were collected from [My Little Gauntlet](https://ponygauntlet.tumblr.com/)
